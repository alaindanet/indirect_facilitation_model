# Thesis: First chapter "Theorical Model"

The main problem is I have coexistence but no positive spatial occurence in the model. As in Gross et al. (2008), the fact of just put an associative protection can promote coexistence between two species in competition. But, in nature, association protection or abiotic facilitation leads to positive spatial co-occurence between two species. This does not happen in my model.
