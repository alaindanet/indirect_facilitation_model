# Effect of indirect and direct facilitation on coexistence and stability of a dryland ecosystem  

## Objectives

Develop a theoretical model of two species in competition and add an interaction
of indirect facilitation. A nurse species is protected against grazing can protect the saplings of a protégée species by associative protection. We make the simple assumption of a growth-defence trade-off.

The cells can take 3 states: occupied by a nurse, a protégée or be empty.
