# Objectives:

1. Find more coexistence between the two species.
2. Get more spatial autocorrelation between the 2 species.

# Tasks:

* Find analytical solution by pair approximation
* Find a smart way to analyse model.

# First step: simple model with 3 states

* We have 3 states ($+$, $0$, $-$).
* We have six different pairs ($\rho_{++}$, $\rho_{+0}$, $\rho_{+-}$, $\rho_{00}$, $\rho_{0-}$, $\rho_{--}$) since $\rho_{\sigma\sigma'} = \rho_{\sigma'\sigma}$.
* We have four conservation equations:
  1. $\rho_{+} + \rho_{0} + \rho_{-} = 1$
  2. $\rho_{+} = \rho_{++} + \rho_{+0} + \rho_{+-}$
  3. $\rho_{0} = \rho_{00} + \rho_{+0} + \rho_{0-}$
  4. $\rho_{-} = \rho_{--} + \rho_{-0} + \rho_{+-}$
* There are 3 singleton variables: $\rho_{+}$, $\rho_{0}$, $\rho_{-}$

So we need $6+3-4 = 5$ equations to solve this system. As in KÃ©fi et al. (2007), I choose $\frac{d\rho_{++}}{dt}$, $\frac{d\rho_{+-}}{dt}$, $\frac{d\rho_{--}}{dt}$, $\frac{d\rho_{+}}{dt}$, $\frac{d\rho_{-}}{dt}$
