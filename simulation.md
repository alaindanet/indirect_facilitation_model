## Tasks

1. Find more coexistence
2. Find more spatial correlation between species

## 1. Coexistence

To get more coexistence between our 2 species, we have to explore  inter and intra competition parameters. There is 2 main scenarii: 1) Intra competition is high and inter is low. 2) Intra competition is low and inter is high as in my previous work.


### 1.1 Scenario 1 : High intra competition and low inter inter

#### Parameters

$c_1 = c_2 = 0.4$, $c_{12} = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]$, $c_{21} = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]$, $b=[0.5,0.6,0.7]$, $g=[0,0.05,0.1]$, $d=0.1$, $r=0.0$, $m=0.2$, $\delta = 0.1$, $n =[0,1]$

#### Results
